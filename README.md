# Jotter
A simple web-based text editor with basic functionalities for the course CS455

## Repository Design
The repository will have two major sub-folders;
- Jotter-Frontend
- Jotter-Backend

## Issues and Tasks
The issues for each are created in the issues tab. Each issue has a priority assigned to itself and is part of a milestone defined in the milestones tab.

The priorities are either of these three types:
- `low priority`
- `medium priority`
- `high priority`

Each issue has a estimate of number of working days written in the description.

Each milestone has a due-date which accomodates all the estimates of the underlying issues in that particular milestone.

These issue will be assigned to the members and pull requests will be created over the same issues accordingly in due course of time.
